## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare the Environment
1. **Enable RDP**:
   - Ensure that Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is enabled for accessing the server remotely.

2. **Download Sysmon**:
   - Download the **Sysmon v15.15** binary:
     - Navigate to the [Sysinternals website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) and download the `Sysmon.zip` file.

3. **Download the Sysmon Config**:
   - Use the modular configuration file for Sysmon:
     - URL: [Sysmon Modular Configuration](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/blob/master/sysmonconfig.xml)
   - Save the file as `sysmonconfig.xml`.

### Step 2: Install Sysmon
1. Extract Sysmon files:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\Sysmon
   dir
   ```

2. Install Sysmon with the configuration file:
   ```powershell
   .\Sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml
   ```
   - Agree to the Sysmon license agreement by clicking **OK** when prompted.

### Notes
- **Sysmon Modular Configuration**:
  - The modular configuration used here helps tailor the Sysmon output to capture relevant events, reducing noise.
  - For further customizations, refer to the [Sysmon Modular GitHub repository](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular).

- **Event Analysis**:
  - Use tools like Elastic Defend or Kibana to ingest Sysmon logs and analyze them for threats.

- **Firewall**:
  - Once testing is complete, consider adding the server to the SOC simulation firewall for secure logging.
