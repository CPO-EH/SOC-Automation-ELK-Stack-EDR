# Investigate RDP Brute Force Attack

This documentation outlines the steps to investigate an **RDP Brute Force Attack** alert using the Elastic Stack and integrate it with osTicket for ticket creation and resolution.

## Step 1: Initial Investigation in Kibana
1. Navigate to your **Kibana Web GUI**.
2. Go to the menu and click on **Alerts** under the **Security** section.
3. Select the **first alert** to review its details and description.

**Rule Description:**
- **Rule:** Detects failed authentication attempts towards the account: **Administrator** via RDP.
- **Alert Reason:**  
   Event from source IP **91.238.181.40** targeting **Administrator** triggered a **medium alert**: `MYDFIR-RDP-Brute-Force-Attempt-TechGneek`.

## Step 2: OSINT Research
Use **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** tools like [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com) and [GreyNoise](https://www.greynoise.io) to research the suspicious IP **91.238.181.40**.

**Key Investigation Points:**
- **Brute Force RDP - 91.238.181.40 - Admin**
  - **Is this IP known to perform brute force activity?**  
    **Yes.**
  - **Any other users affected by this IP?**  
    **Yes:** `Admin`, `Administrator`, `Network Services`.
  - **Were any of the attempts successful?**  
    **No.**
  - **If so, what activity occurred after the successful login?**  
    **Nothing.**

## Step 3: Modify the Elastic Alert
To integrate the alert with **osTicket**:
1. Navigate to the **Rules** section in Elastic Security.  
2. Select the rule for **RDP Bruteforce Attempt** and click on **Edit Rule Settings**.  
3. Add an **Action** to push the rule to **osTicket**:
   - Configure the alert to send relevant details to osTicket for ticket generation.

---

## Step 4: Verify Alert in osTicket
- Open the **osTicket Web GUI** to confirm the alert was received.
- Ensure the alert includes all relevant details for investigation.

## Step 5: Assign and Resolve the Ticket
1. Assign the ticket to an agent in the osTicket GUI.
2. Document your investigation steps and findings.
3. Mark the ticket as **Resolved** and close it.
