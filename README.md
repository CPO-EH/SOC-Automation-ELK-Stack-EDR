# SOC-Automation-ELK-Stack-EDR

## Objective

The SOC Automation & ELK Stack EDR project was designed to simulate a real-world cybersecurity environment where both offensive and defensive measures were implemented. The primary goal was to build a lab for detecting and responding to simulated cyberattacks using the ELK Stack and automated workflows.

### Skills Learned

- Network Threat Detection: Configured ELK Stack for log ingestion, analysis, and alert generation.
- Incident Response: Designed workflows for active response to cyber incidents.
- Automation: Automated alerting and incident ticket creation using integrated tools like osTicket.
- Offensive Security: Simulated cyberattacks using Kali Linux and Mythic C2 to identify weaknesses and 
  validate defense strategies.
- Network Architecture Design: Built a cloud-based infrastructure in Vultr to simulate real-world SOC 
  operations.

### Tools Used

- Elastic Stack (ELK): Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for log management and analysis.
- Mythic C2: Command-and-control framework for attack simulation and payload delivery.
- osTicket: Ticketing system for incident management and response.
- Fleet Server: Managed endpoint agents for data collection and telemetry.
- Kali Linux: Offensive security platform for attack emulation.
- Vultr: Cloud hosting platform for network architecture deployment.
- Elastic Defend: Endpoint protection solution for detecting and responding to threats in real time.
