# Investigate SSH Brute Force Attack

## Step 1: Investigate the Alert in Kibana

1. Navigate to the **Kibana Web GUI**.
2. Go to the **Menu** and click on **Security > Alerts**.
3. Select the **first alert** and review the **rule description**:
   - **Rule Description**:  
     This rule detects failed authentication attempts towards the account: `root`.  
   - **Alert Reason**:  
     Event with source `159.65.147.193` by `root` created a medium alert: `MYDFIR-SSH-Brute-Force-Attempt-TechGneek`.

## Step 2: Conduct OSINT Investigation

We researched the suspicious IP (`159.65.147.193`) using OSINT tools like:
- [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com)
- [GreyNoise](https://www.greynoise.io)

### Key Findings:
- **IP**: Is this IP known to perform brute force activity?  
  **Yes**  
- **Affected Users**: Any other users affected by this IP?  
  **Yes**, 7 users were targeted: `root`, `admin`, `oracle`, `test`, `ansadmin`, `duao`, `ftp`.  
- **Successful Logins**: Were any login attempts successful?  
  **No**  
- **Post-Success Activity**: If so, what activity occurred after the successful login?  
  **N/A**

## Step 3: Configure Alerts to Push to osTicket

1. In Kibana:
   - Go to **Menu > Security > Rules**.
   - Select the **SSH Brute Force Attempt** rule.
   - Click **Edit Rule Settings** and navigate to **Actions**.
   - Modify the rule to send alerts to **osTicket** via webhook.

2. Verify the alert in the **osTicket Web GUI** to confirm it was received.

## Step 4: Resolve `server.publicBaseUrl` Configuration Issue

1. In Kibana, you may encounter an issue where the `server.publicBaseUrl` is not configured.  
2. On your **ELK server**, open the configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
   ```
3. Uncomment the `server.publicBaseUrl` setting and configure it:
   ```yaml
   server.publicBaseUrl: "http://149.28.235.88:5601"
   ```
4. Save the file and restart the Kibana service:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart kibana
   ```

## Step 5: Confirm Alert Integration with osTicket

1. Return to the Kibana **GUI** and verify the issue is resolved.
2. Check the **osTicket Web GUI** to ensure the alert is pulling the rule as expected.
3. Assign the ticket to an agent, resolve it, and close the ticket.
